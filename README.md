# Project Title: Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression

Description:
This project focuses on churn prediction in the telecom industry using logistic regression. Churn refers to the phenomenon where customers switch from one service provider to another. Predicting churn is crucial for businesses to retain customers and take proactive measures to prevent customer attrition.

In this project, we collected a dataset from Kaggle that contains customer information such as gender, seniority, partner status, internet service type, monthly charges, and churn status. The dataset was preprocessed and cleaned to handle categorical variables and ensure data integrity.

The project follows the following steps:

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

We imported libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Loaded the dataset and obtained basic information about the data.
Checked for null values and performed data cleaning.
Converted categorical variables for analysis.
Conducted EDA to compare different columns with churn status.
Visualized the relationship between tenure and churn using a countplot.

# Data Preprocessing:

Used label encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical values.
Applied standard scaling to standardize numerical features.

Splitting Data:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.


# Logistic Regression Model:

Utilized logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm, for churn prediction.
Created and trained the logistic regression model using the training data.
Made predictions on the test set.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the performance of the churn prediction model.
Calculated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Plotted a confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance.

# Conclusion:

The churn prediction model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set.
The precision and recall scores indicate the model's ability to correctly classify churned customers.
Further improvements and model optimization can be explored to enhance the predictive performance.
This project provides a comprehensive implementation of churn prediction in the telecom industry using logistic regression. It serves as a valuable resource for individuals interested in understanding customer churn and developing predictive models to support business decision-making.
